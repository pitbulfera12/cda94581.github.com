I never wanted this, okay? I've just been thrust into a world of political campaigning with no prior knowledge as to how. And it's still 4 years away. And I'm not eligible anyway.
Oh well, it is what it is. Can't wait to be caught by the authorities.
My friends say that they will make the election so only votes in favor of me would be counted. So now, even when I haven't met any of the requirements of eligibility, I'm on the road to 270, and 4 years early. And also by breaking laws. Great. And all because I didn't apply for a Minecraft server.
So now I have to plan my campaign and all the things I would be supporting. My life has just been turned upside down. The next 4 years  will be a stressful one, juggling school, work, and campaigns.
And tonight, I am lying in my bed. Writing. Wondering just what in the world will happen next.</pre>

			<pre class="largecode">
I did not get a good night's sleep yesterday. The thought of being a president in front of 330 million people stresses me out. The thought of achieving presidency without eligibility, and by suppressing voters, makes me feel guilty. But I have to. Or else, my friends tell me.
Even doing my school work today, I was stressing left and right. No matter what I tried to do, I couldn't get the thought out of my head. I'm not sure if my friends knew this but, I was going to be in serious trouble.
At 4 PM, I heard a knock on a door, and saw an authority standing by. Putting on my mask, I opened the door and stepped outside.
"Is your name Blaine?" the authority asked.
"Yes," I replied.
"I hear you wanted to campaign for President in 2024." So my friends announced it. I'll need to have a talk with them later
"Ummm...yeah, my friends kinda forced me to."
"How old are you?" Oh no.
"16."
"Where were you born?" Yikes.
"Canada."
"So, you're telling me you aren't eligible to run." I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
"Yeah..."
"Great, well I'll be voting for you then, see ya round kid."
I just sat there, mouth wide open, for about 5 minutes. Strangers walking by were giving me strange stares. Even though I was wearing my mask, they could somehow see through it, wondering what in the world was wrong with me. I still need to talk to my friends though. I hadn't even agreed.
I picked up my phone and dialed my friend's number.
"Hello Blaine," my friend said.
"Good day to you," I replied. "So, did you just announce my campaign to the world, about 2 and a half years early?"
"Yeah, gotta get it out there ya know."
"I didn't even agree to this."
"Well too bad, I think you'll make a great one. By the way, how was your conversation with the authority?"
"Umm...it went alright I guess. Somehow I didn't get in trouble."
"Awesome. Well, I got to go, let's start planning your campaign tomorrow."
"Uhh...fine," I said, reluctantly.</pre>

			<h3 style="font-weight: lighter;" id="3">Chapter 3</h3>
			<pre class="largecode">
"Ready? Let's get started," my friend said, the next day.
"Uhhh, no. Give me a good reason why I should be running for President."
"Let me ask you this question. What do you want to see for our country?"
"Hmmm, maybe world peace? Or a greater respect for Scientists? Or maybe..." And so I continued to list things on and on. With each new thing I wanted to see, the more I realized, I had to do something to make this happen. I thought about everything I saw on the news, everything I heard from everyone. Everything that was going on and around the globe. And while I was talking, I realized, no one else seemed to be willing to help.
All the politicians in their fame? They didn't care about us. They and their family had everything. And the feeling we didn't have a voice overshadowed me.
"...and also-- Alright fine, I get it. I'll go campaign. But you have to promise me one thing," I finally ended.
"And what might that be?" my friend asked. I felt like I heard a hint of relief there.
"That you do not rig the election. We're supposed to be a democracy. John, let's face it. If the people like me they'll vote me. Oh, and I'm running as an independent."
I heard a sigh on the other end of the phone. Even though I didn't want to be President, and even though I knew I was running against the laws, I decided, if no one else will step up and think about what us normal beings feel, I would do it myself.
"I knew you'd come through," John said. "The people need someone like you. And about the ineligible things...we'll find a way. Shall we begin planning our campaign? First off, we need fund--"
"John, not now. The new President hasn't even been inaugurated yet. Let's wait until that day, okay?" I cut in.
"Well we can't just sit here for another 2 months doing nothing. We need funding for our campaign. Funding."
"So what do we do then, get a job?"
"Sure, get a job, make money in any legal way possible."
"Fine, I'll see what I can do. Goodnight John."</pre>

Over the next few days, I got a part-time job at McDonalds, working 4 hours a day, $8 an hour. Not a lot, but it was a start. My parents got word of my campaign, and we had a long a tough talk. I knew I would have to face the consequences one day, and I decided, better to get it done early. Eligibility problems were still a key issue that kept me up at night, and I knew I would have to figure it out sooner or later. Fortunately, I had a group of family and friends that vowed to get me able to run. I continued to have daily conversations with my friends, sometimes more casual, and sometimes we were dead on serious about the campaign.
Obviously, with a $32 a day pay, funding was still a huge problem. I knew it, my friends and family also knew it. It also kept me up at night, weighing my options. We've tossed around the idea of fundraisers, but that required the country to know, and we also weren't eligible yet. Plus, let's face it. Every single sane person in the entire world would look at me and think, "Why in Earth does this kid think he is, running for president 4 years early? The 2020 one hasn't even been inaugurated yet."
Life was at a quiet time. Everything became a routine. Go to school, call my friends, talk to family. Same old, same old. Days turned into weeks. The President was inaugurated. I gained a passive amount of cash. And an idea hit me.
I started playing Minecraft during the free time that I had, and had gotten into making add-ons, mods, and basically changing the game in any possible way, for a more interesting experience. And I thought, why not share this with the world? With my parents' permission, I started a YouTube channel. After watching a lot of videos about things to do with a channel, I decided that my current topic would be to share my add-ons with the community. And so, here I am, now making myself busier than ever, juggling school, work, YouTube, my campaign, and also having fun.</pre>

			<pre class="largecode">
I'm bored. I don't know how to express it best, but I. Am. Bored.
It's been a few months since my last entry. School is coming to an end. I've been posting weekly Minecraft videos on YouTube. It's gained me about 40 subscribers currently, and a fair bit of views. Not a lot though. Minecraft 1.17 is nearing so I might be able to profit off of that.
The campaign has kept me up at night, tossing and turning, wondering how in the world I can convince my country to allow me to run. Just thinking about it stresses me out to the point that I've tried to forget it existed, and just continued to work, work, work, day after day. I could have everything I needed for my campaign, funding, adverts, anything, but all that wouldn't matter if I wasn't even allowed to run.
So I've been procrastinating. I've tried to put this off and live a normal life, doing YouTube as well.
Speaking of YouTube, using my Java skills I learned in school, I've been working on making an app to make add-ons, which when I finish, I plan to share on YouTube.
Life has never been so boring, however, I'm holding on hope that maybe, just maybe, that app will turn the tides...</pre>

			<h3 style="font-weight: lighter;" id="6">Chapter 6</h3>
			<pre class="largecode">
Weeks continued to fly by. I gained a few more subscribers, but at the rate I was going, I'd never get to where I wanted to be.
School was over, and I had more time on my hands to work on my little app. It was almost complete, I could just imagine the popularity it would gain.
And I set to work. Ever nearing completion, until...
completionStatus.setText("Add-on packaged successfully")
Those last lines were a beauty. I had finally completed my app to the point it was somewhat usable. All that was left was to test it. As I went to package my add-on, about a thousand errors popped up. They said a ton of things about a ';' being expected.
Great.
With the hundreds of lines I wrote, fixing this was going to be a pain. Demotivated, I closed the window and walked away. I was never going to succeed. Never. I felt like quitting. I felt I should just call quits on this campaign as a whole and go live a normal life. But something, the optimist side of me, stopped me from doing so.
And I remembered the day on that call, when I spoke with so much passion, everything I wanted to change. And I knew I had to do it, or no one else would. Then I thought, I still have a chance. Nothing would be impossible once I worked towards it.
And so I picked myself up, walked to my laptop, and was about to fix my app, when something stopped me.
"No," the voice inside my head said. "Take a break, work on the app little by little."
And I knew to listen. I will succeed.
All those who aren't heard by the politians? I will fight for you like no one else has. You. Will. Be. Heard.</pre>

			<pre class="largecode">
There's still time. I've been telling myself those words for the past few weeks. There's still 3 years left to figure everything out and get on the road to 270. And then I remember that I started with 4. That I've already used up 1/4 of my time. And then I stress myself out. Again.
My not so little app is being slowly but surely fixed. I added all the semicolons that were required. There are, of course, other issues, but it's all nearly complete.
My birthday is tomorrow, 7/7. 17 years old. I'm not sure what I want this year, there are simply too many things to name.
And speaking of tomorrow, 1.17 releases tomorrow. I have in mind a lot of videos I want to release.
Speaking of YouTube, I've passed 100 subscribers now, which gives me a custom URL. 100 was a big milestone for me, and I'm sure the next hundred will be easier than the first. Obviously it's still super slow, and I still need a long way to go.
Life has been slow and boring, and so, my entries have also just been a kind of far away tone. I can't wait for when someone actually...happens</pre>

			<pre class="largecode">
So, a lot happened yesterday. 7/7, my birthday. Cave Update. And one very important "present" that may just save my life.
I uploaded a bunch of videos yesterday for the 1.17 Cave Update. The results appear to be paying off today. As I looked at my YouTube Analytics, I had gained over 10K views in the last 24 hours, and another 100 subscribers, pushing my total count to 717, which slowly but surely, means I'm getting there. However, that wasn't the main highlight yesterday.
Last night, on the news, one headline popped out to me. Apparently, a person by the name of TyCraft102 was planning on running for President in 2028, but he wasn't old enough to do so, like me. My current President, James Saighlah, apparently took notice and decided to go to try and lower the age requirement to 35 to 20 when inaugurated, and any citizen, even those not natural born, could run. So for the next few days, weeks, and maybe months, I plan to pay full attention to see if this can be passed by the Senate, House, and in the Supreme Court.
This was a huge miracle for me, and this may also mean many more people will be running, for example TyCraft102. All I need now is a good source of funding, and a good campaign when 2024 comes along.
Oh and I forgot, my app was finally completed yesterday, however 1.17 came out and now I need to update it before I release it to the world.
My birthday was the best I could ask for, and I can't wait for the future.</pre>

Finally, after months of hard work, my app is complete. I plan on releasing the app to only android for the time being.
After a talk with my parents, and after exporting the app from the Android Studio, we headed over to the Google Developer Console. Using the money I've earned from working, I spent $25 and became a developer.
This was a huge moment. I now had unlimited access to share things with billions of users. I took a breath, then went to upload my apk onto the platform. After finishing the final bits, I sat back in my chair, relieved I could finally relax. I had finally done it.

It's been another week. I've been busy just doing the same things over and over again.
My app has gotten noticed by a fair number of people. I plan on updating it with one dollar in-app purchases for the user to be able to develop in beta and old versions, in which I find alright.
Here's what I was thinking, something based around tokens. You buy permanent tokens for one dollar each to use on versions. You get one free token per account. Tokens reset so you can reallocate them elsewhere every update, and you can also setup auto allocation each update.
I only see a maximum of a single token being bought per user though, since older versions aren't needed, only ones for the latest beta and stable versions. This will, of course, mean tons more work of development, however.
The Supreme Court meets tomorrow to discuss and vote President Saighlah's proposal to change the Constitution and lower the age requirement and place of birth. Over the last few weeks, a lot of controversy was sparked by the statement, both support and not. Protests erupted as well, and tomorrow would be the day all may change, or nothing.
Yesterday, I also somehow reached the requirements for the YouTube Partner Program, and so, I, with my parents, applied for it and am now waiting acceptance, or rejection.
I've switched from uploading weekly to uploading daily, and I've been getting quite a bit of views.
My friend called me today as well.
"Hey Blaine, we haven't talked in a while," he began.
"Yeah, it really has!" I replied. "Being busy juggling work, school, YouTube, programming, and the Campaign has been really given me next to no time to so anything."
"I understand. Speaking of which, we should start planning our campaign a bit, now that you are eligible for monetization, have a job, and have an app that has good potential."
"Yeah good idea! So where do we start?"
"Well, let's start by re-identifying what you're running for, then we can work on a slogan. That would be enough for today, I think."
"You know, I've got way too many to name right now. How about I slowly work on that list instead of stating them all and potentially forget some?"
"Ah, yeah, that's a good point. So, slogan. You're fighting for the people like no other president has done, right?"
"Yeah, that's what I plan to do."
"So how does 'Blaine Leelah, People First' sound?"
"I guess it's a good start, however it doesn't capture the fact that I'll fight like no one else has done before."
"That's a good point. So I've got to go for today. Let's talk tomorrow, after the Supreme Court vote, okay?"
"Sure. See ya later Bryson!"
"Bye."</pre>

I remember summers when I was a kid, where I would constantly be sitting around the house, bored because I had nothing to do. Sometimes I could play outside, other times I would just sit and do nothing.
Fortunately for me this summer, I had many projects to do, from my part time job, to YouTube, and also developing my app and planning my campaign. All this has kept my hands full.
But now Summer is coming to an end, and school will start up soon, which will definitely mean I have less time to do other things. So I've started working overtime to wrap things up more.
I watched the Supreme Court decision live yesterday. The session lasted an entire 12 hours before the judges finally voted at a ultra thin 5-4. My phone rang immediately afterwards.
"Oh, hey Bryson!"
"We did it Blaine, we won!"
I swear I could hear him dancing on the other end.
"Yes we did!"
"How's funding?"
"Oh, it's pretty good, I've gained quite a bit of views and downloads, enough to earn some money. I'm also working on an in-app purchase which will hopefully boost as well. I really need to wrap it up though, since school's starting soon and I'll have less time to work."
"Yeah well, keep up the work then. I can't wait for us to start planning everything, and we can change our country. This is our last school year anyway, so unless you're doing college, we can work super hard next year on this."
"Yeah I kind of want to go to college, however I guess I could go after my campaign or Presidency?"
"Yeah true. Keep it up Blaine, I believe in you 100 percent"</pre>

			<h3 style="font-weight: lighter;" id="12">Chapter 12</h3>
			<pre class="largecode">
School's starting today. After walking to school, we took our traditional picture outside.
"Oh Blaine, how much you've grown!" my mom said.
"Yeah, I know," I replied
"I'm so proud of you!"
And with a final hug, I walked into the building.
"Settle down now, settle down," my Social Studies teacher, Mr Braten, said. "Welcome to Social Studies. This year, we will be studying the history of the world, and the forms of government out there. Now let's start by getting to know each other. How about we go around a talk about what we did over the summer? Blaine, why don't you start?"
I noticed a sudden tension in the class.
"My name's Blaine Leelah," I began. "Over the summer, I did a ton of working part time, along with making YouTube videos and I also developed an app using the skills I learned last year."
"Oh nice. What kind of app?"
"One that provides a simple and easy graphical interface to make Minecraft Addons."
"Very nice. James you next."
And so the entire class shared their summer experiences with the rest of us. When my teacher reached Gwendolyn, I couldn't help but notice a sudden stiffness in the class, as if they held something against her, and I couldn't figure it out. It felt the same as the stiffness that I received. Mr Braten and I seemed to be the only ones with a calm expression.
"Alright, let's start our activity for the day," My teacher said, after we all shared. "As some of you may know, the Supreme Court recently passed a change to the Constitution, and that means that some of you guys can run for president in a few years. So, we're going to partner up and share what we'd do as president. You can choose your partners. Feel free to also get to know them more, as they will be your partners for at least the rest of the semester."
Everyone started to pair with their friends, and Gwendolyn and I were the only ones without a partner. I walked over.
"Hey Gwendolyn," I said.
"Oh hey," she replied. "I guess we're partners?"
"Sure."
"You can call me Gwen for short, by the way."
"Ah, alright. Do you want to start, or should I?"
"I guess you can."
"Well, as president, I would..."
And so I started to list everything I had collected. As I was talking, I couldn't help but notice that Gwen looked bothered. I decided to ask about it.</pre>
			<a href="#Top">Jump to Top</a>

			<h3 style="font-weight: lighter;" id="13">Chapter 13</h3>
			<pre class="largecode">
"Hey, is there something bothering you?"
"Huh? Oh yeah, didn't you notice the stiffness in the room when you and I were talking?"
"Oh yeah, do you know what that was about?"
"Yeah, we're both black, ya know? And I'm a girl. And I'm Bi and Trans. And I was born in Iran. Perfect recipe for disaster here."
"Ah yeah, over the summer I forgot how discriminate this school."
She laughed. "How do you forget that?"
"I guess just the fact I was busying myself with a ton of other things."
"Ah, I see. Well yeah, you see, it's just so bothersome. I just wish I could be in a more inclusive school."
"I wish I could help, but unfortunately, I'm in a similar situation."
"Yeah it's fine, but this really needs to be changed," she sighed. "Anyway, I totally agree with your vision as a president. It would probably be my vision as well."
I nod with acknowledgement at her.
"Alright everyone," Mr Braten said, some time later. "That's it for today. I hope you got to know your partners a bit today. Please see me after school if you have any questions or concerns. Enjoy the rest of your day."
And so I headed off to my next class of the day.
After getting my food during lunch time, I headed to my typical lunch table, where I waited for Bryson. I kept picking at my food, because of the thoughts swirling my head. I saw Gwen walking in my direction, also looking distracted.
"Hey," she said, when she walked over. "May I sit here?"
"Sure, everyone's welcome!"
"Thanks."
We both picked at our food, probably thinking about the same thing. A few seconds later, Bryson came over.
"Hey Blaine!" he said. "How's your day so far?"
I shrugged, "It was alright."
"You look troubled, what's the matter? Also, who's she?" he made a gesture towards Gwen.
"Oh, she's Gwen. We're class partners for Social Studies. As for the problem, that would be up to her if she's fine with explaining."
I heard Gwen let out a sigh. "Yeah so, in Social Studies we were supposed to share what we did in summer with the class. When Blaine and I shared, there was a sudden stiffness in the class, because we were black."
"Yeah," I said. "And it also affects her more than me."
"Because I'm a girl, Bi, Trans, and was born in Iran."
"And since I care about all my classmates, I want to help, but am bothered that I can't."
"Ah, I see," Bryson said. "Since I'm white I can't really feel what you feel, which I'm sorry about. However, if there's anything I can do to help both of you, don't hesitate to us, as your peer I will support you in any way possible."
"Thanks," we both said.
Bryson punched me playfully. "Hey, you know you and Gwen talk perfectly together, she'd make a great running mate, ya know."
I laughed, "Bryson...what is it with you and forcing people to run?"
"Huh?" Gwen said.
"You see, Gwen, Blaine here is going to be future president. And you'd be a perfect running mate."
I punched him, "I hate you!"
"Love you too!"
"Hmmm," was the comment from Gwen.
After school, I saw Mr Braten, and he saw me. We both started walking towards each other.
"Blaine, do you know where Gwendolyn is?" he asked. The way he said it, it seemed like he was in a hurry.
"I think she went home, I'm not sure."
"Oh, well, I need to talk to you, and I'd like you to tell her what I said."
"And I need to talk to you about her."
"Alright, you go first then."
"So, when Gwen and I shared what we did in summer, I noticed a stiffness in the class, and Gwen probably did as well. She later informed me it was because we were black, and also because she was female, Bi, Trans, and born from Iran. I hate how discriminate this school is. I wish people of all race, background, sexuality, and more, could walk the halls without worrying about anything. I really want to change the school, but I'm not sure how to."
"Ah, and that was what I was going to talk to you about. As for changing the school, Student Leader applications are open, maybe you could help change the school through that. Make sure that both you and her know that if there's anything I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask."
"Oh, thanks so much."
He nods. "Alright, anyway I need to go now, I'll see you tomorrow, take care now."
"Bye Mr Braten, thanks for everything."</pre>

Once home, I headed straight for my room, and stayed there for a while. My parents must've noticed something was wrong, since they asked about it during dinner.
"Blaine, what's the matter?" they asked.
I sighed, then explained everything, again.
"Ah, I see," my mom said. "I’m so sorry to hear that though. You did nothing that I know of to deserve this, so if there’s any way we can help, please let us know."
"Yeah, thanks mom." I sighed. "You know, I just wish I could do something about it, us ‘lesser’ people outnumber the ‘superiors’, yet we’re treated as inferiors. I just want it to stop." I then remembered my conversation with Mr Braten. "I talked to my teacher about this after school, and he suggested I apply for a Student Leader. I think it might actually be something I like, since it would give me experience in leading, and maybe, it would also help to change the school, and maybe the district, to be more inclusive."
"Oh, that’s a great idea! When’s the deadline? Where do you sign up? Is there-" she noticed me slumping in my chair. "What is it, Blaine?"
"Well you know, from my time in highschool, there’s never been a black Leader. It would be hard for me."
"Oh come on Blaine. Nothing stopped you from deciding to launch a campaign, when you were underage, now did it? You can’t do anything until you try, and try you must. This is for your sister, for your friends, for everyone that comes after you. You know that saying? ‘Believe you can and you’re halfway there.’ Well now it’s time for you to believe, and then try. Unless of course you don’t want to help the world."
I got up. "Yeah, you’re right mom. Thanks a lot. I’ll go apply after dinner."
"Sounds good, tell us if you need anything."
My family, although "inferior", as other people would put it, is one I love with all my heart. They’ve never left my side. I always had a supportive family I could come home to, and express any feelings I had, and receive all the support and motivation I needed. From my conversations with other classmates and friends, some were afraid to talk to their parents. Some even still were afraid to even see them. And it dawned on me just how fortunate I was.
I opened my notebook and added to my list.
*Invest in programs to make people feel safe and supported.*
Then I turned on my computer and opened the form. I was determined to become the first "inferior", and change the school for the better.</pre>

Day 2 was probably worse than day one. At Social Studies, we started our learning. I also passed on the message that Mr Braten told me yesterday, to Gwen. As partners, we worked together with our school assignment.
Then came Science. It was, like almost any other class, terrible. My teacher treated me as though I didn't exist. When asking a question that no one except I knew, he looked over me and just continued on.
"No one?" he said. "Well that's disappointing, the correct answer is…"
This continued on and on. The only thing I was looking forward to was ELP.
"Alright everyone, welcome to ELP," my teacher said. "Today, we will be working on developing our project for this semester. As with any year we’ve done this, you get to choose what you want to research, and what your final product will be. So, let’s get to work then, shall we? You should have received an email from me with a link, where you can get some ideas. At the end of class today, we will be sharing what we plan on doing, and then filling out our ILP."
I already knew what I was going to be doing. However, the link always contained interesting things in the years past, and so I decided it would still be a good idea to take a look.
My ELP teacher was what you would call more laid back. She never really forced or enforced anything, so there would always be those people who just play games and get away with it. However, I’ve always found her material interesting, and so I’ve been encouraged to pay attention.
I like her style of things, however, some enforcement would also be helpful.
The fact that we get to choose what we want to learn and research is something that I’ve always enjoyed. Back in Elementary and early Middle School, it used to be something along the lines of, "Oh hey! You’re advanced at math! Great, now do more math," while this is like, "Oh hey! You’re advanced! Great, now you can use this time to pursue your interests, since you already know the material." That’s the kind I realized I liked, when I first started doing it.
As we neared the end of the period, we started going around and sharing the things we were going to do this semester.
"And Blaine, what about you?" my teacher asked. I felt the same stiffness I felt yesterday, again.
"I want to launch a project to root out all discrimination in our school," I said.
"I see, and might I ask why you chose this project?"
I took a deep breath. "Well, for over 12 years now, I, along with many other peers of mine," I looked around the classroom, at all the other "inferiors", "we’ve been harassed, discriminated, and whatnot all because of the amount of melanin we have. It’s just not fair, and most other teachers are only encouraging, not condemning this. So I want to change this. And if I can’t finish this year, I’ll pass it on to my sister, and she can help."
I could feel the "superiors" glaring at me.
"That’s a fair point," she said. "Well, tell me if you need my help on anything."
The "superiors" continued glaring at me as she continued about the room. I just made an ally and some enemies, I realized.</pre>

It’s been a few days since my last entry. Some people have cornered me to pester me because of the color of my skin, however nothing really has happened. Last night, I received an email from my teachers:
"Dear student,
	We appreciate you applying for Student Leader. It was a pleasure to read how you’ve impacted others before. We want to congratulate you on becoming a Student Leader. We look forward to making Stillwater Area High School the best it can be, together. Attached is a Google Form so we can decide the best time to meet. Please respond as soon as possible. Also, make sure to check your email daily for information.
Again, congratulations on becoming a Leader!

Brad Braten, John Hayden, Molly Gretan
Student Leader Advisors"
As a family, we welcomed the news, and the chance to change the school. I then went and submitted the Google Form.
Today, I got an email back, stating that we would be meeting every day, after school from 3-4 PM, in Mr Hayden’s room. I also got a link to an agenda that we could update, to keep us organized.
In between school and things, I continued to work on my app, and YouTube. Uploading a trailer showcasing my app was one of the best things I could’ve done, as I gained a bunch of early downloaders from my loyal subscribers, and it also gained me more subscribers, because people were apparently searching for add-on makers. I now sit at about 3K subscribers and I have about 500 downloads, and surprisingly, I have a few people who have made the in-app purchases. I could actually do this.
I’ve also been considering launching a Patreon page if people want to support me, but I’m debating whether it’s too early for that to happen.
I’m nervous about meeting the other Leaders for the first time tomorrow, but at the same time, I’m also excited. Considering the history of the school, however, I wouldn’t be surprised if all the other Leaders were white.</pre>
