			<h2 id="Schema" style="text-align: center;">Fogs Schema</h2>
			<p>Format: <span class="code">type name //comment</span><br />If item is optional, <span class="code">opt</span> will be placed in front<br />Although Minecraft is fine with it, Normal JSON does not support <span class="code">//</span> comments, and as such, files with them will be invalidated, and so I recommend you remove the comments<br />Commas are important, don't forget them. Schemas do not contain commas however, you'll need to add it yourself.<br />Sticking with only the distance object is typically enough, and volumetric is much more advanced. I've done my best to add comments in a comprehendible way.<br />An example is provided below using everything in the schema, as an example to help comprehend more.<br /><br />Schema</p>
